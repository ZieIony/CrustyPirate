This game is a project created by me during a course on the gamedev.tv platform. It's a simple, pixelart, platform game with just one enemy, very simple mechanics and even more simple UI. Assets have been included in the course. My goal is to make this game more professional, fun and complete. The asset pack includes other enemies, more tilesets, more animations, and UI, that I would like to use. Other improvements I'm thinking about include:

 - bugfixes (there's visible tearing or z-fighting for some reason),
 - background music,
 - better AI (enemies fall from edges now, and they attack even if the player is on another platform above or below),
 - better enemy movement (patrolling would be nice),
 - more levels,
 - more upgrades,
 - a bunch of gameplay improvements, like not colliding with platforms from below.

The code is also very basic. It could be safer and cleaner. I'd also like to see if it's possible to write automatic tests for gameplay code.
